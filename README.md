**gridsky-app/kit** is a monorepo playground for the Core and UI libraries of Gridsky.

The code is shared to support collaboration and transparency as the project evolves. While the official client won't be open source in the traditional sense, the license allows for contributions and involvement — just not wholesale cloning or rebranding. The more the community engages, the more open it may become.

## Contributing

The main Gridsky App isn't open source yet — we're working on a compact version called Gridsky Pocket, designed to help fund development while focusing on the core libraries and essential features which will be available under the MIT license. Gridsky Pocket will be released under the Gridsky Community License.

```bash
# fork these two repositories

# https://github.com/gridsky-app/kit
# (name it "gridsky-playground")

# https://github.com/gridsky-app/pocket
# (leave it "pocket")

# clone your gridsky kit fork 
git clone git@github.com:<username>/gridsky-playground.git

# enter the directory you just cloned
cd gridsky-playground

# clone your gridsky pocket fork into /apps/pocket
git clone git@github.com:<username>/pocket.git /apps/pocket

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start the pocket client
nx run pocket:serve
```
